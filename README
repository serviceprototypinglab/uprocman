====================================================================

Procman manages groups of processes launched through it. Child processes
and former children turned into zombies are safely tracked and traced.
All processes can be assigned to tenants with a per-tenant accounting
of when and how long each process was invoked. This makes procman
a suitable solution for when root access is not possible or desired
and still a multi-tenant process management is needed.

Invocation:
-----------

./procman start <...> starts an application process
./procman -T start <...> does the same but wraps the execution into a tracer
./procman -t <...> start <...> launches the process for a specific tenant

./procman status shows the status of the launched processes, potentially of all tenants
./procman -T status gives full insight into the tracing and zombie processes
./procman -t <...> status limits the status view to one tenant

./procman stop <...> stops the process again, no matter if -T was used or not
./procman -t <...> stop <...> obviously does the same for a specific tenant

Files:
------
tracer/procman-tracetest.sh is the working tracer (the python one does not work)
.procman.db and .procman.<...>.db are the generic and tenant-specific pid lists
.procman.log and .procman.<...>.log are the associated accounting logs
.procman.pid.* are temporary tracer support files
.procman.tenants is the list of tenants
